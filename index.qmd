## Economist  | Data Scientist 

I am an applied microeconomist, employing econometric and data science tools to address problems in environmental, health, and labor economics practicing both causal inference and machine learning techniques. 
<!-- When I am away from my desk, you may find me running, biking, bouldering, or spending time enjoying the outdoors. -->

I will receive my PhD in Economics from the University of [Oregon]{.note .red} in June 2025.
