# Economist  | Data Scientist 

I am an applied microeconomist, employing econometric and data science tools to address problems in environmental, health, and labor economics practicing both causal inference and machine learning techniques. When I am away from my desk, you may find me running, biking, bouldering, or spending time enjoying the outdoors.

I will receive my PhD in Economics from the University of Oregon in June 2024. I will be participating in the 2024 ASSA job market, so I can be available to discuss my fit with your open position
