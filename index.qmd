# Economist  | Data Scientist 

I am an applied microeconomist, employing econometric and data science tools to address problems in environmental, health, and labor economics practicing both causal inference and machine learning techniques. When I am away from my desk, you may find me running, biking, bouldering, or spending time enjoying the outdoors.

I will receive my PhD in Economics from the University of Oregon in June 2024. I will be participating in the 2024 ASSA job market, so I can be available to discuss my fit with your open position

<!-- Safer saying these are toolkits and these I am tooled up. Can't say that. They don't want someone who will do whatever you want--I am busy doing something interesting. They want to convert me to theirs and are willing to pay me to do that. Totally tooled up. If I haven't done what they do, I am obviously something capable of learning. interested and engaged in the world. 

Environmental is second order. Maybe a little {{< 
It has to read, 'yeah he looks like a junior version of ed and glen. ' >}} -->

# [Economics PhD Candidate [arrow_forward_ios]{.material-icons} University of Oregon]{.subtitle} 

[_On the market 2024_]{.note}

## Welcome

Iâ€™m a 5th year doctoral student at the University of Oregon and am actively seeking opportunities for the 2023-2024 job market cycle.

I am an applied microeconometrician and data scientist. My research interests are spread equally between causal inference and prediction. I use cutting-edge data science techniques and creative data sources to make new contributions to economic questions at the cross section of environmental, health, and labor economics. When I am away from my desk, you may find me outside climbing, hiking, or backpacking throughout the Pacific Northwest.
